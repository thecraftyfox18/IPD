# IPD

In this project the iterated prisoner's dilemma was implemented via a neural network, both in the case of reactive and non reactive strategies. For reactive strategies the program will choose the best technique against the opponent, in order to optimize both scores. For non reactive strategies the program has to choose which user to face, with a planned strategy in order to let the user achieve the highest score.

The code uses the axelrod library.
To use the code you have to download also the train parameters; the train parameters were made for the selected reactive (0) and non reactive (1) strategies and the numbers 0.1 0.01 and 0.001 refers to the noise used in the games.
